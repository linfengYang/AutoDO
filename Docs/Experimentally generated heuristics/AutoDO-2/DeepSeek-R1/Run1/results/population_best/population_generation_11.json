Initialize commitment: set must-on to committed, must-off to off, and flexible units to their previous state  \n3. Calculate feasible power ranges for committed units considering ramp and startup/shutdown constraints  \n4. Compute total min/max generation and adjust commitment:  \n   - Under-committed: activate flexible units by lowest (startup cost + min-power cost)/min-power  \n   - Over-committed: decommit non-must-on units by highest min-power cost until min-gen \u2264 load  \n   - Adequate: decommit non-must-on units by highest min-power cost if system adequacy holds  \n5. Perform constrained economic dispatch:  \n   - Set initial output to minimum feasible power for committed units  \n   - Distribute residual load to units with smallest marginal cost (b_i + 2c_i*p_i)  \n6. Return commitment states and power outputs for all units  \n\n",
